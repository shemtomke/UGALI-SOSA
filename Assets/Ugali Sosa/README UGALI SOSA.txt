Hey Shem,
Thanks for working with me on this.

UGALI SOSA UI GUIDE
*******************
So the Game has a design formula like this.

MENU >> Level Selection >> Game

with the

Level Selection:
***************

1:It's a full screen left-right selection menu
2:Each level will be represented by the following 

 LEVEL 1:
 (SHACK 01 >> Nyumbani)

 LEVEL 2:
 (SHACK 02 >> Kwa-Local)

 LEVEL 3:
 (SHACK 03 >> Jambu Cafe)
 
 LEVEL 4:
 (SHACK 04 >> Kwa-Wanyoni)

 LEVEL 5:
 (SHACK 05 >> Njambi's)

They will be presented as so on the map
The "Did You Know?" section is on the Level Selection Scene

Game Play
*********

So, I'd like you to make a player system, where:
if the player wins, the head changes to show hapiness
if the player loses, the head changes to express shock.
this player could also express shock, if he "eats" a bomb, or chilli.
this player could also show hapiness, if he "eats" ugali, or nyama.


i hope this helps
